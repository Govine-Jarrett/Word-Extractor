<h4>Why Word Ex was created?</h4>
<p>This was initially made as a function that was very important for one of my Python CLI applications.

While I was learning Python I discovered this amazing tool called <a href="https://github.com/alejandroautalan/pygubu-designer">Pygubu Designer</a>
to help speed up the process of creating GUI applications in python, so I decided to try it out and WordEx was created.</p>
